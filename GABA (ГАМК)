GABA is known for producing a calming effect. It's thought to play a major role in controlling nerve cell hyperactivity associated with anxiety, stress and fear. Scientists also call GABA a non-protein amino acid neurotransmitter.

GABAÂ helps slow down messages being sent by other neurotransmitters, which allows your brain to process that information at a more relaxed pace. This keeps you from becoming anxious or overwhelmed.
