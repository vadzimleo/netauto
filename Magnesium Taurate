Magnesium and taurine also have antioxidant properties that may protect the heart[3] (https://www.forbes.com/health/supplements/magnesium-taurate/#footnote_3)[5] (https://www.forbes.com/health/supplements/magnesium-taurate/#footnote_5)[8] (https://www.forbes.com/health/supplements/magnesium-taurate/#footnote_8). Some research in animals and one small study in men shows taurine and magnesium supplementation can stimulate cells that help repair heart blood vessels

There is a correlation between lower levels of taurine and higher systolic blood pressures,” notes Gellerstedt. But while taurine supplementation may help lower blood pressure, few studies have been done in humans.
There are no concerns for toxicity with taurate (taurine),” says Dr. Stein. Taurine is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Magnesium is more likely to cause problems if taken in excess. Too much magnesium may cause nausea, diarrhea and weakness
Individuals with kidney disease are more likely to experience side effects from magnesium, he says, explaining that kidneys help excrete excess magnesium from the body.
The present study showed that oral taurine supplementation is able to suppress UVB-induced wrinkle formation, which may be associated with the regulation of moisture content in the epidermis.
The exposure of the mice to UVB radiation for 4 weeks resulted in a decreased moisture content and increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in the skin, while taurine supplementation suppressed these changes. Oral supplementation with taurine for 8 weeks ameliorated the development of UVB-induced wrinkle formation. Furthermore, oral taurine supplementation for 4 weeks decreased pre-stablished wrinkles in a dose-dependent manner.
